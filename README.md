# Description

We present a framework for controlling a [type of] robot using hand gestures as an input. We leverage [open-source hand pose estimation software](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/) to collect control input from a camera mounted on a desk near the robot. This allows users to control a robot for pick-and-place tasks in an intuitive manner, without the need for peripheral input hardware.
